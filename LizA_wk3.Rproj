title: "Week 3-Intro to data types"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Notes: 2/7
Create repos externally on github, then clone to R studio using Sourcetree. Make adjustments using commit in Sourcetree. When you change the file in R studio and save, it will be tracked in Sourcetree. Will have to "push" manually in ST to update this info on Github. 
Can move an existing notebook into this directory

##DATA TYPES

Basic types of data in R:
1. Numeric
  i) Integer
  ii)Float or double
2. Logical
3. Character (strings)
4. Complex

##Code chunks

ctrl+alt+i creates code chunk
Can name code chunk. if you add a space after the r, you can allow arguments. Providing variables for data to work with. If using multiple arguments, use , between words. It will auto fill in arguments. We'll get to the specifics later. 
Bottom of screen- "DATA TYPES" keeps track of the names and # of your code chunks. Name chunks to keep them in order. 
Can also add headers, which will appear in the list
```{r types}
